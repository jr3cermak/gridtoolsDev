# MOM6 and MOM6 grids

```
# Both ROMS and MOM6 horizontal grids use an Arakawa C-grid, with four
# types of points:
#   rho: the centers of the cells
#   psi: the corners of the cells, located diagonally between the
#        'rho' points
#   u:   the u-velocity points, located between 'rho' points in the
#        east/west direction
#   v:   the v-velocity points, located between 'rho' points in the
#        north/south direction

# The main differences between the two grids are:
#  * the outermost points of the ROMS grid are the 'rho' points, while
#    the outermost points of the MOM6 grid are the 'psi' points (both
#    with interspersed 'u' and 'v' points); and
#  * the MOM6 grid interleaves all four types of points into a single
#    "supergrid", while ROMS stores them as separate grids.

# The ROMS grid looks like this, with an extra layer of 'rho' points
# around the outside:
# (see https://www.myroms.org/wiki/Numerical_Solution_Technique)
#
#       p - p - p - p - p
#    3  | + | + | + | + |     p = rho (center) points
#       p - p - p - p - p     + = psi (corner) points
#    2  | + | + | + | + |     - = u points
#       p - p - p - p - p     | = v points
#    1  | + | + | + | + |
#       p - p - p - p - p
#
#         1   2   3   4

# The MOM6 grid has 'psi' points on the outside, not 'rho':
#
#    3    + | + | + | +       p = rho (center) points
#         - p - p - p -       + = psi (corner) points
#    2    + | + | + | +       - = u points
#         - p - p - p -       | = v points
#    1    + | + | + | +
#
#         1   2   3   4
