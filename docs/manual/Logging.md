# Logging

At the default state, the program will emit important messages about
assumptions it made in creating or modifying the grid in memory.

This library, and many other python libraries, heavily leverage the
built-in [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html)
library.

TODO: Write more documentation!

For now, please review the [mkGridsExample2.py](../gridTools/mkGridsExample2.py)
python script for some initial terse details on how to work with the
messaging and logging portion of the library.

If you discover a bug or problem with the, we will want to be provided as much
information as possible to help us fix the issue.  Please see the
[reporting](Reporting.md) section of the user manual to assist developers.
