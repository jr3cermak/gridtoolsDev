# Application

This details the application portion of the grid tools library.

# Getting Started

The application is generally run inside a python notebook,
jupyter notebook, jupyter lab or jupyter hub.  Once the script
it loaded, all the cells should be executed to start the application.

The developers have prepared the code to operate on a remote cloud
system at mybinder.org.
