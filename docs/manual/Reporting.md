# Reporting

Found a BUG? We love bugs as much as we love grids!

It is very helpful to tell us as much as possible about the situation
that triggers this bug.  It is helpful if the developers can
`reproduce` the bug on our systems.

What information is helpful:
 * What software are you using?
   * Application?
   * Writing your own script?
     * Please provide a copy of your code and any input files
     * Large files may require other means to provide access
 * Please describe the steps to reproduce the problem or error
 * Please provide as much as possible
   * Cut and paste error messages; provide log output
   * Screenshots can be useful
   * Copies of code, input and output files
 * If you have a solution to the problem
   * Code may be submitted in the form of a github pull request
 * Other useful information
   * Windows or Unix/Linux (`uname -a`)
   * Python and other module versions
     * Use the sysinfo module to provide python and module information.  See mkGridsExample2.py for an example of use.  The
       sysinfo module only works for conda based environments.

After all the information is collected, it is helpful to file an
[issue](https://github.com/ESMG/gridtools/issues)
on the github repository for tracking purposes.
