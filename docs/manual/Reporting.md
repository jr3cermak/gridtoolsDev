# Reporting

Found a BUG? We love bugs as much as we love grids!

It is very helpful to tell us as much as possible about the situation
that triggers this bug.  It is helpful if the developers can
`reproduce` the bug on our systems.

After all the information is collected, it is helpful to file an
[issue](https://github.com/ESMG/gridtools/issues)
on the github repository for tracking purposes.
